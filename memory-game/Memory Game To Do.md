# Memory Game ToDo
- [x] Click Event listener on all boxes with event listener knowing the square number 
- [x] put cards on all the squares
- [x] turn over card on click
- [x] make a card object/class?
- [ ] make a game object/class?
- [ ] put pairs of stuff on the cards
- [ ] make the rest of the game!


## Game Logic
1. On Load, assign random pair values to cards
2. On each turn: 
   1. First click turns over a card
   2. Second click turns over a second card
   3. if the two card values are the same, leave them up otherwise flip them over after a delay
